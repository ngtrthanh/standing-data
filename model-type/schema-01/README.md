# Model Types Schema 1

## Files

Each model type is stored in a CSV file whose name is formed from the first
character of the type's ICAO code.

The reason for this is to try to avoid having a very large CSV file.

## Content

The file is a comma-separated value file. Strings are optionally
delimited with double-quotes. Commas within quoted strings are
ignored. Double quotes within quoted strings are escaped with
a second double quote.

The first row contains column headings.

## Columns

There is one row for each model type.

| Ordinal | Heading               | Type   | Meaning |
| ---     | ---                   | ---    | --- |
| 0       | `ICAO`                | string | The ICAO 8643 code of the aircraft, unless it starts with a hyphen in which case it is a fake code. |
| 1       | `Manufacturer`        | string | The name of the manufacturer. |
| 2       | `Model`               | string | The name of the model. |
| 3       | `Engines`             | string | The number of engines or the letter `C` for multiple engines combined. |
| 4       | `EngineTypeCode`      | string | A single character code describing the type of engines used. See below. |
| 5       | `EnginePlacementCode` | string | A single character code describing the placement of the engines. See below. Rarely filled. |
| 6       | `SpeciesCode`         | string | A single character code describing the species of aircraft. See below. |
| 7       | `WakeTurbulenceCode`  | string | A 3 character code describing the severity of wake turbulence generated by the aircraft. See below. |
| 8       | `IsActive`            | number | 1 if the ICAO and / or the combination of manufacturer and model is still in use for this type, 0 if it is no longer in use. |

### Future-proofing
The schema allows for new columns to be added in the future, with the
following caveats:

* The ordinal, heading, type and meaning of existing columns will not change
  in future versions of the file.
* New columns will always be added after existing columns.

## Fake Types

ICAOs that start with a hyphen are fake, they are not real ICAO 8643 codes. They are
used for vehicles and structures that have been assigned Mode-S codes.

As of time of writing ICAO are only allocating four character alphabetical codes so
*hopefully* there shouldn't be a clash between fake and real codes in the future.

## Engine Type

| Code | Engine Type |
| ---  | --- |
| `E`  | Electric |
| `J`  | Jet |
| `P`  | Piston |
| `R`  | Rocket |
| `T`  | Turboprop |

## Engine Placement

| Code | Engine Placement |
| ---  | --- |
| `A`  | Aft-mounted |
| `B`  | Wing-buried |
| `F`  | Fuselage-buried |
| `N`  | Nose-mounted |
| `W`  | Wing-mounted |

## Species

| Code | Species |
| ---  | --- |
| `A`  | Amphibian |
| `G`  | Gyrocopter |
| `H`  | Helicopter |
| `L`  | Landplane |
| `S`  | Seaplane |
| `T`  | Tilt-wing |

## Wake Turbulence

| Code  | Wake Turbulence |
| ---   | --- |
| `H`   | Heavy |
| `L`   | Light |
| `L/M` | Light or Medium |
| `M`   | Medium |
| `M/H` | Medium or Heavy |
